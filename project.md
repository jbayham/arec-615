This document elaborates on the modeling project requirements described in the course syllabus.

## Overview

The modeling project allows you to apply the optimization methods learned in class to a real economic problem in **natural resources, agricultural production, or environmental regulation**. You will select a research article, replicate its optimization model (fully or partially), and implement a meaningful economic extension.

The goals of the project are to:

- Gain experience **programming and solving optimization models** in R.
- Practice **interpreting economic results** from mathematical programming.
- Engage with **research models** and extend them in an original way.

---

## 1. Project Components

### A. Proposal (10%)

A one-page proposal that includes:

- Full citation of your chosen article  
- A summary of the paper  
- An explanation of the optimization methods 
- A description of your intended extension  

### B. Model Identification & Replication (20%)

Select a peer-reviewed article whose core methodological contribution is an optimization model, such as:

- Linear programming  
- Nonlinear programming  
- Dynamic programming  
- Other optimization approaches used in applied environmental/resource/agricultural economics 
- or other based on instructor approval

**Replication requirements**

- A full replication is ideal but **not required**.  
- If data are inaccessible, you may:
  - Conduct a **structural replication**, or  
  - **Simulate data** to reproduce the model’s logic.  
- The model's complexity should match **your background and research needs**.


### C. Model Extension (30%)

Propose and implement a **substantive change** that explores a meaningful economic concept. Examples include:

- Relaxing a key assumption  
- Adding or modifying a policy-relevant constraint  
- Changing the objective function  
- Introducing uncertainty or risk  
- Embedding the model in a dynamic framework  

Your extension should demonstrate:
- Understanding of the original model  
- Ability to adjust and resolve optimization problems  
- Interpretation of how your modification affects outcomes  



### D. Final Report (20%)

A 5–8 page technical report, written for the instructor.

**Required sections**

1. Introduction  
2. Summary of the original paper and model  
3. **Full mathematical model specification**  
4. Replication strategy and results  
5. Description of your extension  
6. Results and interpretation  
7. Conclusion  


All code and documentation must be submitted through a **GitHub repository**.

**Requirements**

- Code may include manual steps, but all such steps must be described in a `README.md`.
- The repository should be organized and include:
  - R scripts or Quarto notebooks  
  - Data (or simulated data)  
  - Output (optional)  

Reproducibility will be evaluated based on clarity, organization, and completeness.




### E. Presentation (20%)

A **20-minute presentation** plus **5 minutes of Q&A**.

**Required content**

- Model’s economic intuition  
- Mathematical structure  
- Replication results  
- Description of your extension  
- Economic interpretation and implications
