# Course Orientation & Motivation

-   Why optimization in economics?

    -   Many economic problems are decision problems under constraints where some agent is pursuing an objective and faces constraints.

    -   Examples:

        -   A farmer allocates land and water across crops.
        -   A firm chooses output facing costs and regulations.
        -   A planner designs climate policy subject to resource limits and production technologies.
        -   A consumer maximizes utility subject to income.

-   Analytical solutions not always possible → need **numerical/computational methods**. Closed form solutions do not exist.

    -   We will learn to optimize both analytically and numerically.

-   Mathematical programming provides a structured, computer-implementable way to model these decisions.

# What is a Mathematical Program?

-   **General Form**:

    $$    \max_{x} f(x) \quad \text{s.t. } g_i(x) \in S_1, \; x \in S_2    $$

-   Components:

    -   **Decision variables**: choices (e.g., acres planted, production levels).
    -   **Objective function**: what we optimize (profit, cost, utility).
    -   **Constraints**: resource limits, technology, budgets. 
        - These constraints can be that functions of $x$ lie within some boundary or that the individual $x$'s lie in some boundary

**Example (crop mix):**

-   Variables: acres in wheat ($x_1$), corn ($x_2$).
-   Objective: maximize profit.
-   Constraints: land, labor, water.

# Uses of Mathematical Programming (McCarl §1.3)

```         
What does McCarl say are the uses of math programming?
```

1.  **Problem Insight Construction**

    -   State problem carefully and really understand the moving parts
    -   Clarify objectives, constraints, and trade-offs.
    -   Example: Writing down a water allocation model forces us to quantify resource limits. It also forces one to write down the functional relationships between variables, which may be a simplification or approximation of a physical or natural phenomenon: hydrology, population growth functions, atmospheric models.

2.  **Numerical Applications**

    -   **Prescription of Solutions**

        -   Goal: Recommend an **optimal plan** given data, objectives, and constraints.

        -   Example: Farm crop mix — how many acres of wheat, corn, soy to maximize profit?

    -   **Prediction of Consequences**

        -   Goal: Forecast **outcomes under scenarios**.
        -   Example: If fertilizer availability drops 20%, what happens to optimal output and profit?

    -  **Demonstration of Sensitivity**

        -   Goal: Show how solutions **shift with parameters**.
        -   Example: How does optimal irrigation use change as water prices rise?

3. **Algorithm Development**

    - solution algorithms... not that important for most of us.

# Preview: How Optimization Methods are Used in Research

- **Agricultural & Resource Economics**
  - Crop mix and land allocation models under climate or policy changes.
  - Water allocation across sectors or regions.
  - Forestry and rangeland management under biological growth constraints.

- **Environmental Economics**
  - Policy design problems: cap-and-trade, carbon taxes, renewable energy portfolios.
  - Nonpoint pollution control, groundwater management.
  - Climate-economy integrated assessment models.

- **Industrial Organization & Production**
  - Firm cost minimization and production planning.
  - Transportation and logistics networks.
  - Supply chain optimization.

- **Public Policy & Development**
  - Food aid allocation and trade policy.
  - Health policy interventions under budget constraints.
  - Energy access and electrification planning.

Takeaway: *Mathematical programming is not just a classroom exercise; it’s a core toolkit for applied economic research.* The methods we learn will connect directly to how we ask and answer research questions in environmental, agricultural, and resource economics.
