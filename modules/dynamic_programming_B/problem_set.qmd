## Problem 1

Backstop technology and optimal switching (continuous time)

Consider a planner who must meet a constant flow demand D using either: 

i. extraction from an exhaustible stock $S(t)$ at rate $x(t) ≥ 0$ with convex extraction cost, or 
ii. an unlimited “backstop” technology $y(t) ≥ 0$ with constant unit cost B. 

The planner minimizes the present value of total costs with discount rate $\rho > 0$.

- State: $S(t) ≥ 0$ with $S(0) = S0$.
- Controls: extraction $x(t) ≥ 0$ and backstop use $y(t) ≥ 0$.
- Flow constraint: $x(t) + y(t) = D$ for all $t ≥ 0$.
- Stock dynamics: $\dot S(t) = −x(t)$.
- Extraction cost: $C(x) = 1/2 c x^2$ with $c > 0$.
- Backstop cost: $B y(t)$ with $B > 0$.

Thus the planner’s problem is
$$
\min_{\{x(t),y(t)\}_{t\ge0}} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} \Big[ \tfrac{1}{2}c\,x(t)^2 + B\,y(t) \Big] dt
\quad \text{s.t.}\quad
\dot S(t) = -x(t),\; S(0)=S_0,\; x(t)+y(t)=D,\; x(t),y(t)\ge 0.
$$

a) Eliminate $y(t)$ using the flow constraint and write the problem with one control $x(t) \in [0, D]$. Write the current-value Hamiltonian $H(S,x,\lambda)$. Clearly state the state equation, control bounds, and the transversality condition.

b) Derive the first-order necessary conditions (Pontryagin):
  - control condition $∂H/∂x = 0$ for an interior solution,
  - co-state equation $\dot \lambda = ρ λ − ∂H/∂S$,
  - state equation $\dot S = −x$,

Show that (for interior $x$) the optimal policy satisfies
$$
x(t) = \frac{B - \lambda(t)}{c},\qquad \dot\lambda(t) = \rho\,\lambda(t).
$$

c) Solve the co-state ODE and show that $\lambda(t) = \lambda_0 e^{\rho t}$.

Argue that $0 < x(t) < D$ followed by a switching time $T^*$ at which $x(T^*) = 0$ and the backstop fully supplies demand thereafter ($y(t) = D$ for $t \geq T^*$).

d) Assuming the interior $0 < x(t) < D$ until the switch, derive closed-form expressions for the switching time $T^*$ defined by $\lambda(T^*) = B$.

e) Comparative statics. For the pre-switch phase ($t < T^*$), characterize how $x(t)$ and $T^*$ change with each parameter $c$, $B$, $\rho$, and $S_0$. Provide economic intuition for each sign.
