  <h1>Farm Resource Allocation Problem</h1>
  <p>
    A farmer has 500 acres of land available and is deciding how to allocate it between wheat and corn. 
    Each acre of wheat yields a profit of \$200, requires 3 hours of labor, and 4 units of fertilizer. 
    Each acre of corn yields a profit of \$300, requires 4 hours of labor, and 3 units of fertilizer. 
    The farm has at most 1,800 hours of labor available and 2,000 units of fertilizer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Formulate this situation as a linear programming problem. Clearly define the decision variables, 
    write down the objective function representing total profit, and specify the constraints that capture 
    the land, labor, fertilizer, and nonnegativity restrictions.

  <h2> Wheat price increase </h2>
  <p>
    The price of wheat just increased from \$200 to \$230 per acre. 
    Without running a solver, reason out what happens using <em>duality</em> and <em>complementary slackness</em>.
  </p>

   <ol>
    <li><strong>Write the dual with the new profit vector.</strong> For dual variables $y_1,y_2,y_3 \ge 0$ (land, labor, fertilizer), the dual is
      $$\min\ 500y_1 + 1800y_2 + 2000y_3 \quad \text{s.t.}\quad 
      \begin{aligned}
      y_1 + 3y_2 + 4y_3 &\ge 230 && \text{(wheat)} \\
      y_1 + 4y_2 + 3y_3 &\ge 300 && \text{(corn)}
      \end{aligned}$$
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> With $c_W$ up to $230$, do you expect wheat to enter the optimal plan? Which constraints are likely to bind?</li>
    <li><strong>Find a cheap feasible dual</strong> $(y_1,y_2,y_3)$ that satisfies the two “$\ge$” constraints. Can you make one or both constraints bind at equality to lower the dual objective?</li>
    <li><strong>Use complementary slackness to recover a primal corner.</strong> If your dual has $y_i&gt;0$, the corresponding primal constraint must bind. Solve the implied binding constraints to get $(x_W,x_C)$ and check feasibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Compare values.</strong> Check that $c^\top x = b^\top y$ at your candidates (strong duality). What changed relative to the pre-shock optimum?</li>
  </ol>
  
  
  <details markdown="1">
    <summary><strong>Hint 1 (dual inspection):</strong> Try setting one dual variable to zero to cut cost. Which $y$ has a better return?</summary>
    If you try \(y_3=0\) (fertilizer price 0), and force both activities to be produced (so both dual inequalities bind), solve:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    y_1 + 3y_2 &= 230 \\
    y_1 + 4y_2 &= 300
    \end{aligned}
    \Rightarrow
    y_2 = 70,\; y_1 = 20.
    $$
    This gives a feasible dual \((y_1,y_2,y_3)=(20,70,0)\).
  </details>
  
   <details markdown="1">
    <summary><strong>Hint 2 (why \(y_2\) dominates \(y_3\) now?):</strong></summary>
    Per unit cost, \(y_2\) “covers” 3–4 units in the dual constraints and costs 1800. The \(y_3\) variable covers 3–4 as well but costs 2000. Setting \(y_3=0\) and using \(y_1,y_2\) tends to be cheaper.
  </details>

  <details markdown="1">
    <summary><strong>Reveal: A low-cost dual & value</strong></summary>
    With \((y_1,y_2,y_3)=(20,70,0)\),
    $$
    \text{Dual value}=500(20)+1800(70)+2000(0)=136{,}000.
    $$
    Both dual constraints hold at equality for the produced activities (see below), so this is a strong candidate for optimal dual prices.
  </details>

  <details markdown="1">
    <summary><strong>Recover the primal via complementary slackness</strong></summary>
    Because \(y_1>0\) and \(y_2>0\), the **land** and **labor** constraints must bind in the primal; \(y_3=0\) implies fertilizer can be slack. Solve:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    x_W + x_C &= 500 \quad (\text{land binds})\\
    3x_W + 4x_C &= 1800 \quad (\text{labor binds})
    \end{aligned}
    \Rightarrow
    x_C=300,\; x_W=200.
    $$
    Check fertilizer: \(4(200)+3(300)=1700\le 2000\). The new profit is
    $$
    230\cdot 200 + 300\cdot 300 = 136{,}000,
    $$
    matching the dual value (strong duality).

    <summary><strong>Discussion prompts</strong></summary>
    <ul>
    <li>*Entry:* Why did wheat enter at 230 but not at 200? (Connect to reduced cost / allowable increase.) </li> 
    <li> *Prices:* Why did the labor shadow price fall from 75 to 70 after wheat entered? </li>
    <li> *Binding set:* Which constraints bind pre-shock vs post-shock, and why does that matter for shadow prices? </li>
    <li> *Policy:* If labor availability rose by 10 hours post-shock, how much would profit increase, and which constraint binds next? </li>
    </ul>
