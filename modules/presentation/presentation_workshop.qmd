## What the presentation is

A research presentation is not a paper on slides. 

It’s an argument - visual, narrative, and selective - designed to help your audience understand: 

- why your question matters, 
- what you did, 
- what we should take away

## The 3 Jobs of a Research Presentation

1. Persuade the audience that the question matters
2. Demonstrate methodological credibility
3. Deliver an intelligible and memorable result 


---

## Job 1: Convince us the question matters

- Why should anyone care about this question?
- What economic intuition makes the relationship interesting or ambiguous?
- What is the real-world motivation (policy, behavior, inefficiency)?




---

## Job 2: Demonstrate methodological credibility
Audience is asking: “Can I trust your analysis?”

- Present the logic of your design simply.
- Use a diagram, timeline, or conceptual picture rather than blocks of text.
- Show the intuition visually

Explain why alternative explanations are unlikely.

---

## Job 3: Deliver intelligible, memorable results

Your audience will remember 1–3 main findings, not 12 regression tables.

- Use figures over tables
- Highlight only key pieces of information
- Summarize direction, magnitude, and economic significance
- Put your policy-relevant takeaway in plain language

## The Research Narrative Spine {.scrollable}

A simple template for storyboarding - like a screenplay for empirical work.

**The Narrative Spine**

1. Problem / Puzzle (rely on the paper)
2. Gap in prior literature (rely on the paper)
3. Your contribution / extension
4. Data
5. Methods
6. Results
7. Implications / Limitations


---

## Common Presentation Pitfalls

- Too much text, causing the audience to read instead of listen
- Overloaded methods slide that no one can follow
- Regression tables copied from Stata
- Burying the lead (“Here are 12 robustness checks before the main finding…”)
- Telling the story chronologically (“First I cleaned the data…”) instead of logically
- Talking to the screen rather than the audience
- Ending abruptly without a takeaway

---

## Warm up: the 60-second sell

Students partner up and have 60 seconds to explain:

- The question they address
- Why it matters
- Main finding

Then partners give feedback on clarity.

## Storyboarding Your Talk

Now that we know the jobs of a research presentation and the structure of a good narrative, we’re going to storyboard your talk. 

Think of this as designing the flow of ideas rather than the slides themselves
