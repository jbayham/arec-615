## Why Presentations Matter
- Presentations are *not* papers. Your goal is to **communicate, not document**. 
- You must **persuade listeners you’ve done something valuable**—and do it quickly. 
- Audiences remember only a few key points. Make sure they're the right ones. 

---

## The Three Core Questions
Every good economics talk answers three things clearly:

1. **What are you asking?**  
2. **Why should we care?**  
3. **What are you doing about it?**  

>Jackson emphasizes being explicit about the question
>Shapiro stresses motivating the “why.”

---

## Start Strong
- Motivate the problem in 1–2 slides.
- State your **research questions** in one concise slide  
- Explain *why it matters*—policy relevance, theoretical gap, empirical importance.

> Kehoe: *“Start fast. Tell them exactly what you are doing.”*  



---

## A Common Failure Mode
### Presenting the *paper* instead of the *ideas*
- Avoid long literature reviews.
- Don’t walk through every estimation detail.
- Don’t show tables that **look like journal tables**.

> Jackson: “Your audience is not reading. They are listening.”  

---

## 3 Types of Presentation

1. Brown bag (work in progress)  
   - Focus on identification strategy and preliminary results.  
2. Conference talk (15–20 min)  
   - Focus on motivation, identification, and main results.  
3. Job market talk (45 min)  
   - Tell a complete story with motivation, methods, results, and conclusion.

## Visual Design Principles
### (Schwabish’s “Better Figures” Rules)

1. **Clarity:** remove chart junk.  
2. **Consistency:** use the same colors, shapes, scales.  
3. **Efficiency:** highlight only the message-carrying elements.  
4. **Interpretation matters:** labels > legends; direct labeling > mental decoding.

## Designing Figures for Talks
### Good figures *show the point* without explanation
- Titles should contain the finding (“Treatment increases adoption by 20%”).  
- Annotate directly on the graph (arrows, circles, emphasis).  
- Use color sparingly and purposefully.  

> Schwabish: Visuals must “carry the message even if the speaker stopped talking.”  

---

## Avoid These Figure Problems
- Overlapping confidence intervals without explanation  
- Too many lines on one plot  
- Tables with >10 numbers  
- 12-variable regression tables  
- Dense axis labels  

<br>
(Schwabish offers multiple before/after examples.)

## Presenting Empirical Methods
### Keep Identification Simple
Shapiro stresses: 

- Focus on the **intuition** of identification.
- Use plots to show assumptions (parallel trends, discontinuities, first stage).  
- Only introduce equations if they move the audience’s understanding forward.  


---

## Presenting Equations
- Show **only** the key equation.  
- Highlight (color/bold) the coefficient of interest.  
- State the estimation target: “$\beta$ captures the causal effect of ….”  
- Move quickly to a visual before showing results.

> Kehoe warns against “math for its own sake.”  


---

## Showing Results
### Use Visual Summaries
- Replace large coefficient tables with:
  - Effect plots  
  - Event studies  
  - Coefficient plots  
  - Difference-in-differences visualizations

> Shapiro: people understand pictures; tables are for appendices.  

---

## Interpreting Results
- Put magnitudes in real-world units (“equivalent to 5 extra days of work”).  
- Link back to original motivation.  
- Acknowledge limitations transparently.  
- Avoid overstating external validity.

> Jackson: *“Economists trust honesty more than polish.”*  


---

## Avoid Jargon Walls
- Define specialized terms quickly.  
- Replace buzzwords with plainer language.  
- Use economic intuition before econometrics.  


---

## Slide Design Rules

- One idea per slide.  
- 6–8 lines max.  
- 20pt font minimum.  
- Large margins, whitespace.  
- Use consistent color palette.  
- Never read from the slides.  

> Schwabish strongly emphasizes typography and spacing for readability.  


---

## Practice & Delivery

- Rehearse transitions; avoid verbal fillers.  
- Maintain eye contact.  
- Speak slower than you think you need to.  
- Time yourself: target **about 2 min per slide**.

> Kehoe: most talks are too slow and too detailed.  


---

## Handling Questions
- Questions help you — they reveal audience misunderstandings.  
- Don’t get defensive.  
- Restate the question for the room.  
- Admit when you don’t know.  

> Jackson: “Grace under fire is remembered more than results.”  


---

## Ending Strongly
- Summarize your **three main takeaways**.  
- Reconnect to policy relevance or theory.  
- Invite collaboration or feedback.  
- End with your conclusion slide visible.

> Shapiro: the last 30 seconds heavily influences perceived quality.  


---

## Final Thoughts
Presentations succeed when:

- the ideas are clear,  
- the visuals are simple,  
- the audience understands the identification,  
- and the results answer an interesting question.

Your job is to *teach* your paper in 15 minutes.
