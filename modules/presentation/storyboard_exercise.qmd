title: "Storyboarding Exercise"
---

Storyboarding is extremely effective because it forces you to think structurally rather than trying to create slides.

## Instructions

### Define the Story Arc (3–4 minutes)
Write down the core storyline using your narrative spine:

- Problem
- Gap
- Contribution
- Data
- Method
- Key results
- Implications

### Storyboard the Slides (15 minutes)

- Create a linear sequence of 10–14 slides.
- Each slide must contain:
    - Slide title (e.g., Motivation: Urban wildfire risk)
    - Purpose (e.g., why the audience should care)
    - One visual idea (table, map, graph, figure)

### Peer Review (10 minutes)
Pair up and give feedback on each other’s storyboards:

- Where is the logic unclear?
- Are there too many results?
- Is identification explained?
- Are visuals doing the work?
- What could be cut?

### Revision
Revise your storyboard based on peer feedback.
