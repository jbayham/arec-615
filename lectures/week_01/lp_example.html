  <h1>Farm Resource Allocation Problem</h1>
  <p>
    A farmer has 500 acres of land available and is deciding how to allocate it between wheat and corn. 
    Each acre of wheat yields a profit of $200, requires 3 hours of labor, and 4 units of fertilizer. 
    Each acre of corn yields a profit of $300, requires 4 hours of labor, and 3 units of fertilizer. 
    The farm has at most 1,800 hours of labor available and 2,000 units of fertilizer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Formulate this situation as a linear programming problem. Clearly define the decision variables, 
    write down the objective function representing total profit, and specify the constraints that capture 
    the land, labor, fertilizer, and nonnegativity restrictions.
