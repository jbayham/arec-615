# **Unit 1 Lecture Notes: Introduction to Mathematical Programming**

------------------------------------------------------------------------




## **Day 1: Motivation & Modeling Foundations**

### Introductions
    - Who am I?
    - Student introductions: What year and what field? Research interests?

### Course Orientation & Motivation

-   Why optimization in economics?

    -   Many economic problems are decision problems under constraints where some agent is pursuing an objective and faces constraints.

    -   Examples:

        -   A farmer allocates land and water across crops.
        -   A firm chooses output facing costs and regulations.
        -   A planner designs climate policy subject to resource limits and production technologies.
        -   A consumer maximizes utility subject to income.

-   Analytical solutions not always possible → need **numerical/computational methods**. Closed form solutions do not exist.

    -   We will learn to optimize both analytically and numerically.

-   Mathematical programming provides a structured, computer-implementable way to model these decisions.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What is a Mathematical Program?

-   **General Form**:

    $$    \max_{x} f(x) \quad \text{s.t. } g_i(x) \in S_1, \; x \in S_2    $$

-   Components:

    -   **Decision variables**: choices (e.g., acres planted, production levels).
    -   **Objective function**: what we optimize (profit, cost, utility).
    -   **Constraints**: resource limits, technology, budgets. 
        - These constraints can be that functions of $x$ lie within some boundary or that the individual $x$'s lie in some boundary

**Example (crop mix):**

-   Variables: acres in wheat ($x_1$), corn ($x_2$).
-   Objective: maximize profit.
-   Constraints: land, labor, water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Uses of Mathematical Programming (McCarl §1.3)

```         
What does McCarl say are the uses of math programming?
```

1.  **Problem Insight Construction**

    -   State problem carefully and really understand the moving parts
    -   Clarify objectives, constraints, and trade-offs.
    -   Example: Writing down a water allocation model forces us to quantify resource limits. It also forces one to write down the functional relationships between variables, which may be a simplification or approximation of a physical or natural phenomenon: hydrology, population growth functions, atmospheric models.

2.  **Numerical Applications**

    -   **Prescription of Solutions**

        -   Goal: Recommend an **optimal plan** given data, objectives, and constraints.

        -   Example: Farm crop mix — how many acres of wheat, corn, soy to maximize profit?

    -   **Prediction of Consequences**

        -   Goal: Forecast **outcomes under scenarios**.
        -   Example: If fertilizer availability drops 20%, what happens to optimal output and profit?

    -  **Demonstration of Sensitivity**

        -   Goal: Show how solutions **shift with parameters**.
        -   Example: How does optimal irrigation use change as water prices rise?

3. **Algorithm Development**

    - solution algorithms... not that important for most of us.




------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Linear Programming (LP) Structure

-   **Standard LP Form**:

    $$
    \max \; \pi'x \quad \text{s.t. } Ax \le b, \; x \ge 0
    $$

-   Characteristics:

    -   Linear objective.
    -   Linear constraints.
    -   Nonnegativity.

Can also be written in matrix notation.

**Economic interpretation:**

-   $\pi$: profit per unit.
-   $A$: resource use matrix.
-   $b$: resource endowment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model Building Process (McCarl framework)

1.  Identify **decision variables**.
2.  State the **objective**.
3.  Identify and formulate **constraints**.
4.  Collect data.
5.  Translate into computer-readable form.
6.  Solve and interpret.

--------------------

### Farm LP Example

A farmer has 500 acres of land available and is deciding how to allocate it between wheat and corn.
Each acre of wheat yields a profit of $200, requires 3 hours of labor, and 4 units of fertilizer.
Each acre of corn yields a profit of $300, requires 4 hours of labor, and 3 units of fertilizer.
The farm has at most 1,800 hours of labor available and 2,000 units of fertilizer.

Formulate this situation as a linear programming problem. Clearly define the decision variables,
write down the objective function representing total profit, and specify the constraints that capture
the land, labor, fertilizer, and nonnegativity restrictions.

**Decision variables.**  
Let $W$ = acres of wheat, $C$ = acres of corn.

### Scalar (algebraic) form
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_{W,C}\quad 
& 200\,W + 300\,C \\
\text{s.t.}\quad 
& W + C \le 500 && \text{(land)}\\
& 3W + 4C \le 1800 && \text{(labor)}\\
& 4W + 3C \le 2000 && \text{(fertilizer)}\\
& W,\; C \ge 0~.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Matrix (compact) form
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_{x\in\mathbb{R}^2_{\ge 0}}\quad 
& c^\top x \\
\text{s.t.}\quad 
& A x \le b,
\end{aligned}
\qquad
\text{with}\quad
x=\begin{bmatrix}W\\[2pt]C\end{bmatrix},\;
c=\begin{bmatrix}200\\[2pt]300\end{bmatrix},\;
A=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1\\
3 & 4\\
4 & 3
\end{bmatrix},\;
b=\begin{bmatrix}
500\\
1800\\
2000
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

### 7 Assumptions of Linear Programming

Linear programming models rely on a set of assumptions that make them tractable but also limit their realism. McCarl & Spreen (Ch. 2.4) identify **seven important assumptions**. The first three involve the *appropriateness of the formulation*; the last four describe *mathematical properties* of the LP model.

---

#### 1. Objective Function Appropriateness
- The objective function is assumed to be the **sole criterion** for evaluating solutions.  
- This means the decision maker’s preferences can be fully represented by a single linear function (e.g., profit, cost, utility).  
- In practice, decisions may depend on multiple objectives (profit, risk, leisure), but LP assumes one dominates.



#### 2. Decision Variable Appropriateness
- All relevant decision variables must be included, and each must be **fully controllable** by the decision maker.  
- Omitting key variables or including variables outside the decision maker’s control invalidates the formulation.



#### 3. Constraint Appropriateness
- Constraints must **accurately and completely capture** the limits faced by the decision maker:
  - They fully describe resource, technological, and institutional limits.  
  - Resources within a constraint are **homogeneous** and freely substitutable among activities.  
  - No constraint should arbitrarily rule out feasible choices.  
  - Constraints are assumed to be **inviolate** (cannot be bent outside the model).



#### 4. Proportionality
- Contributions of activities to the objective function are **proportional** to their level.  
- Likewise, resource use is proportional: doubling an activity doubles its input use.  
- This rules out fixed costs, economies of scale, or price effects that depend on output level.



#### 5. Additivity
- Total contributions to the objective and resource use are the **sum of individual contributions**.  
- No interactions among variables are allowed (e.g., no multiplicative terms).  


#### 6. Divisibility
- Decision variables can take on **fractional values**.  
- This assumes continuous activities (e.g., acres of land).  
- When variables must be integer (e.g., number of tractors), integer programming is required instead.


#### 7. Certainty
- All parameters (objective coefficients, resource availability, input-output coefficients) are **known with certainty**.  
- LP is thus a deterministic model.  
- In practice, parameters are often estimated, and uncertainty can be explored with sensitivity or stochastic programming.



### Teaching Note
These assumptions both **enable LP to be solvable** and **limit realism**. They provide a natural segue to later topics in the course:

- Multi-objective programming (relax objective function assumption)  
- Integer programming (relax divisibility)  
- Stochastic programming (relax certainty)  
- Nonlinear programming (relax proportionality and additivity)

### 2. Graphical Solution Method (2 variables)

**Step 1. Draw the constraints.**

- Land: $W + C \le 500$
- Labor: $3W + 4C \le 1800$
- Fertilizer: $4W + 3C \le 2000$
- Nonnegativity: $W, C \ge 0$
- Plot based on endpoints. set one var 0 and devote all resources to that var.



```{r}
#| echo: false

xW <- seq(0, 500, by=1)
land_line <- 500 - xW

labor_line <- (1800 - 3*xW)/4

fertilizer_line <- (2000 - 4*xW)/3

library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(
  xW = xW,
  land = land_line,
  labor = labor_line,
  fert = fertilizer_line
)

vertices <- data.frame(
  xW = c(0, 0, 0, 200, 371, 500),
  xC = c(0, 500, 450, 300, 171, 0)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x=xW)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=land), color="blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y=labor), color="red") +
  geom_line(aes(y=fert), color="green") +
  geom_point(data=vertices, aes(x=xW, y=xC), size=3, color="black") +
  geom_text(data=vertices, aes(x=xW, y=xC, label=paste0("(",xW,",",xC,")")),
            hjust=-0.1, vjust=-0.5, size=3) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,600), ylim=c(0,600)) +
  labs(x="Wheat",y="Corn")


```


**Step 2. Identify the feasible region.**

- Intersection of all constraints in the $(W, C)$ plane.
- Polygon bounded by lines.

**Step 3. Plot the objective function.**

- Profit = $200W + 300C$.
- Show isoprofit lines:
    - Suppose we plot \$6000 profit. All wheat no corn, then all corn no wheat.
    - lines of constant profit slope $-\tfrac{200}{300}=-\tfrac{2}{3}$.

**Step 4. Locate the optimum.**

- Slide the isoprofit line outward until the last point of contact with the feasible region.
- Optimum is always at a **corner point** (fundamental theorem of LP).

---

### Simplex Method

#### Why We Need It
- The graphical method only works for **two variables**.
- Real problems may involve **hundreds or thousands** of variables.
- Key geometric fact:  
  - The feasible region of an LP is a **convex polytope**.  
  - The **optimal solution lies at a vertex (corner point)**.  What about the problem makes this a fact?
- The simplex method provides a **systematic way** to move from vertex to vertex until the best one is found.

---

#### Core Idea
- Start at a **basic feasible solution (BFS)** — a corner point of the feasible region.
- At each step:
  1. Compute **reduced costs** (how much the objective improves if a variable increases from 0).
  2. Identify an **entering variable** (the candidate to increase).
  3. Determine which constraint binds first — this sets the **leaving variable**.
  4. **Pivot** to a new BFS.
- Stop when no variable can improve the objective — this is optimal.

---

### Intuition
- Simplex is like **walking along the edges** of the feasible polygon.
- At each corner, ask: *“If I move along this edge, does profit go up?”*
- Continue until no edge yields improvement.
- The same logic applies in higher dimensions, even though we cannot draw the polytope.

## Simplex Pivot — Tiny Worked Example

We use the smallest LP that still shows the mechanics:

**Problem**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max\; & z = 3x_1 + 2x_2 \\
\text{s.t. }& x_1 + x_2 \le 4, \quad x_1 \le 2, \quad x_1,x_2 \ge 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

**Standard form (add slacks $s_1,s_2$)**
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_1 + x_2 + s_1 &= 4,\\
x_1 + s_2 &= 2,\\
z - 3x_1 - 2x_2 &= 0, \qquad s_1,s_2\ge 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

---

### Initial tableau and choice of entering/leaving variables

**Initial BFS:** $x_1=x_2=0 \Rightarrow s_1=4, s_2=2, z=0$.

**Tableau**
$$
\begin{array}{c|rrrr|r}
 & x_1 & x_2 & s_1 & s_2 & \text{RHS}\\\hline
s_1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 4\\
s_2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2\\\hline
z   & -3 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\end{array}
$$

- **Entering variable:** look at the objective row; most negative reduced cost is under $x_1$ (coefficient $-3$) → **enter $x_1$**.
- **Leaving variable (ratio test):** divide RHS by the positive entries in the $x_1$ column:  
  Row $s_1$: $4/1=4$, Row $s_2$: $2/1=2$. Minimum is 2 → **leave $s_2$**.
- **Pivot element:** the entry at row $s_2$, column $x_1$ (which is $1$).

We will **pivot on that 1**, swapping $s_2 \leftrightarrow x_1$.


### Row operations (make pivot column a unit vector)

Goal: pivot column $(x_1)$ should become $(0,1,0)^\top$.

1) **Normalize pivot row** (already 1, so no change):
$$
(s_2)\;:\;[\,1\;\;0\;\;0\;\;1\;|\;2\,].
$$

2) **Zero out the other entries in the $x_1$ column:**

- Row $s_1$: $(s_1) \leftarrow (s_1) - 1 \cdot (s_2)$
$$
[\,1\;\;1\;\;1\;\;0\;|\;4\,] - [\,1\;\;0\;\;0\;\;1\;|\;2\,]
= [\,0\;\;1\;\;1\;\;-1\;|\;2\,].
$$

- Row $z$: $(z) \leftarrow (z) + 3 \cdot (s_2)$
$$
[\,-3\;\;-2\;\;0\;\;0\;|\;0\,] + 3\cdot[\,1\;\;0\;\;0\;\;1\;|\;2\,]
= [\,0\;\;-2\;\;0\;\;3\;|\;6\,].
$$

---

### New tableau (after one pivot)

$$
\begin{array}{c|rrrr|r}
 & x_1 & x_2 & s_1 & s_2 & \text{RHS}\\\hline
s_1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 2\\
\color{blue}{x_1} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2\\\hline
z   & 0 & -2 & 0 & 3 & 6\\
\end{array}
$$

- **Basis after pivot:** $\{\,s_1,\;x_1\,\}$.  
- **Current solution:** $x_1=2,\; x_2=0,\; s_1=2,\; s_2=0,\; z=6$.  
- The column labels show that **$x_1$ entered** (blue row) and **$s_2$ left**.

**Next step (if continuing):** the most negative in the $z$-row is under $x_2$ (−2), so $x_2$ would enter next; the algorithm would pivot again and reach the optimum at $(x_1,x_2)=(2,2)$ with $z=10$.
