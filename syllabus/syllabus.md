## Course Description

This course provides graduate students in agricultural, environmental, and resource economics with a rigorous introduction to optimization methods used in economic modeling and policy analysis. Emphasizing both theory and computation, the course covers linear and nonlinear programming, dynamic optimization, and numerical methods essential for solving complex economic problems. Students will learn to formulate, solve, and interpret optimization models using R, with applications drawn from land use planning, natural resource management, agricultural production, and environmental policy design. The course equips students with practical modeling skills and analytical tools that support evidence-based research and decision-making in applied economics.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. Formulate and solve numerical optimization models in economics.
2. Use optimization software to solve economic optimization problems (with a focus on R).
3. Interpret results from mathematical programming models in applied settings.

## Prerequisites

AREC 506 or equivalent. I assume students are familiar with basic microeconomic theory (e.g., producer, consumer, general equilibrium) and constrained and unconstrained optimization.

## Assignments and Grading

| Component                | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Problem sets (∼4)  | 20%        |
| Midterm Exam            | 20%        |
| Final Exam              | 30%        |
| Modeling project        | 25%       |
| Participation           | 5%         |

I will use the standard CSU grading scale including + and - where the thresholds are defined at 2 and 8 of each 10-point range.

### Homework

There will be about 4 problem sets covering the material and tools covered in class. The problem sets will constitute the majority of the work during the first part of the course. 

### Exams

There will be a midterm and final in-class exam. The exams will be written and not require you to run code on a computer. The final exam will be cumulative. 

### Modeling Project

As part of this course, you will complete an applied modeling project that allows you to integrate the optimization techniques learned in class with your research interests. The project has three main components:

- **Model Identification and Replication**: Select a peer-reviewed journal article or working paper that includes a mathematical programming model (linear, nonlinear, or dynamic). You will analyze the structure of the model, including its objective function, constraints, and underlying economic rationale. Then, replicate the model using R, using your own code and data where appropriate.

- **Model Extension**: Propose and implement a meaningful extension to the original model. This could involve relaxing an assumption, adding a constraint, changing the objective function, introducing stochastic elements, or embedding the model in a dynamic framework. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to not only understand existing models but also contribute original insights.

- **Written Report and Presentation**: Submit a short technical report (approximately 5–8 pages) describing the original model, your replication results, your extension, and the economic interpretation of your findings. The report should include code snippets and relevant figures or tables. You will also give a brief presentation of your project at the end of the semester.

Deliverables:

Project Proposal: Submit a one-page proposal identifying your chosen article, model type, and intended extension.

Final Report and Code: The code must be reproducible.

Presentation: During the final two weeks of the course
